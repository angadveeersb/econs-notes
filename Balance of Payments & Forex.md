## Definition
* ::BOP::  of a country — statement of all the _international transactions of a country with the rest of the world_ over a period of time, usually a year. -- The flows of currency are recorded in the country’s BOP
* BOP made up of — Current account, Capital and financial account, Reserve Assets 

### Current Account
1. Payments for exports and imports of G/S **BOT**
2. Primary Income 
	* consists of income flows such as **wages, rent, interests and profits** flowing in/out of the country
	* Primary income balance = different b/w primary income receivable by SG residents from abroad and primary income payable to non-residents in foreign countries from SG
3. Current transfers (Secondary Income) — unilateral transfers of money to other countries (eg. Sending wages to other countries, govt grants and aid to other countries ($28M to IMF to help low income countries tackle pandemic) 

### Capital & Financial Account 
* Capital account records international transactions of _physical assets (land, buildings & factories)_ and _financial assets (stocks and shares, bonds, bank deposits and loans)_
* Consists of: 
	1. Direct Investments of fixed assets, FDI classified as long term capital flows (existing vs. new assets -> change in AD via I)
	2. Portfolio investments — financial assets such as stocks, bonds, etc. -> relatively liquid (can be sold or converted into cash without any loss of value)
		* outflow of currency, short term capital flows (moving to countries with higher IR and/or expected appreciation of forex rate = hot money)

### Reserve Assets
* transactions in official reserves that are held by country’s central bank 
* central banks can hold foreign reserves that can be used to buy home currency and vice versa

## BOP Equilibrium 
* A country’s BOP position determined by the flows of currency in both the current account and the capital and financial account
* Bop in equilibrium when total inflow of currency is equal to total outflow 
* inflow > outflow -> bop surplus 
* outflow > inflow -> bop deficit

# Forex System 
## Definition
Foreign exchange rate is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another in the forex market
Demand for a country’s currency in forex market depends on foreign demand for local g / s / assets
Supply of a country’s currency is dependant on the country’s demand for foreign g / s / assets 

## Exchange rate determination
### Floating exchange rate system 
![](Balance%20of%20Payments%20&%20Forex/FAEB9275-9C98-4462-A4E9-DEB9AA460C71.png)
* Change in demand — if there is an increase in demand by jap for sg exports it results in increase in demand for S$ as japs need S$ to pay for the exports -> Demand curve shifts from D to D1
* At current exchange rate there will be a shortage of S$ -> cause S$ to appreciate 

* Change in supply — if there in increase in demand for jap imports there will be an increase in supply of S$ as they have to sell their S$ to obtain Yen. 
* At current exchange rate there will be a surplus of S$ causing it to depreciate

* an appreciation of S$ can be caused by either an increase in demand for S$ or fall in supply of S$ or both
* similarly, a depreciation of S$ can be caused by either a decrease in demand for S$ or increase in supply of S$ or both
* in a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate will adjust to equalise the currency demand and supply
### Managed float exchange rate system
* a system where exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate according to market forces within an undisclosed band
* The central bank will intervene to sell off (increasing SS of S$) or to buy back (increasing DD for S$) in the currency in the forex market to keep the exchange rate within the band

## Causes of BOT deficit / surplus
* **Worsening** of the BOT occurs when size of _BOT deficit grows_ or when _BOT surplus falls_
* **Improvement** of BOT occurs when _BOT deficit decreases_ of when _BOT surplus rises_

1. **Changes in domestic price level relative to foreign price level**

* Increase in domestic prices causes imports to become relatively cheaper -> substitute for imports
* demand for imported g/s rises -> M rises
* exports become less price competitive -> qty demanded for exports falls 
* assuming demand is price elastic, export revenue decreases ( _gain in revenue from rise in price less than loss in revenue_ from _more than proportionate fall in qty demanded_)
* BOT worsens

* Cause of changes in country’s domestic price levels relative to foreign price levels
	* Different rates of inflation between counties (eg. A facing cost-push inflation because wage rates rising faster than labour productivity, UCOP rises, loss of price competitiveness off g/s in global markets leads to worsening BOT
	* Change in comparative advantage

2. **Changes in country’s exchange rate** 
	* leads to changes in price competitiveness of country’s g/s affecting BOT
	* foreigners lower demand for SG exports -> export revenue falls 
	* imported goods cheaper -> purchase more imports -> qty demanded for imports into sg rises
	* if demand price elastic, M will rise -> with X falling and M rising, balance of trade worsens
	**PRICE ELASTIC, IMPORTS CHEAPER -> M WILL RISE**
	**PRICE INELASTIC, IMPORTS CHEAPER -> M WILL FALL**
	* Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, an appreciation of country’s currency leads to worsening of trade balance
	* Depreciation of country’s currency leads to improvement of trade balance if MLC is satisfied

3. **Changes in economic growth rates**
	* key trading partners (recession / inflation)
	* domestic consumers income levels

4. **Govt Policies**
	* if govt policies to boost country’s EG / lower dd-deficient unemployment -> rise in national income -> consumers during more imports -> worsen the BOT
	* aim to cool down economy that is experiencing inflationary pressures eg. Raising interest rates to reduce borrowing and AD
	* labour policies which impact labour costs (higher unit labour costs -> g/s being less price competitive -> fall in qty demanded for exports)
	* protectionism policies

Whether BOT falls in deficit or move into surplus depends on initial state of economy 
If initially balanced -> demand for X falls -> BOT goes into deficit
If large surplus -> fall in X -> reduction in surplus

## Consequences of BOT D/S

### Consumers
* May affect MSOL

::**BOP Deficit**::
* Depends on 1. **Type of imported good (capital/consumer good)** 2. **Time Period**

* If BOPD due to inc. levels of consumption of **consumer g/s** -> short term benefit 
* in long term, lower SOL for future generations as excess spending needs to be paid for by borrowing from foreign lenders -> future gen sacrifice their consumption to repay this past debt

* if BOPD due to increasing import of **capital goods**, sacrifices rise in living standards in current period since loans could have been used to buy imported consumer goods
* however, M of capital goods increases country’s capital stock -> increases productive capacity & price competitiveness of g/s in world market -> boost qtydd for X -> generate EG in future
* AS shifts right and down -> fall in prices and rise in equilibrium national output -> MSOL rises in LR

::**BOP Surplus**::
* X > M -> surplus could have been used to finance more imports into the country -> enabling people to consumer more -> lower SOL in SR
* BOTS -> net lender -> receiving interest payments from abroad -> adds onto the country’s GNI -> increase in people’s buying power -> higher MSOL in LR

### Firms 
* affect country’s forex rate -> impact revenue + cost for firms

::**Worsening BOT**::
* -> Increase in outflow & decrease in inflow of currency -> currency depreciates
* improves price competitiveness of domestic firms’ products vs. foreign products
* however, imported inputs more expensive in domestic currency terms -> higher COP & reduce profits for dom firms that import units
* float exchange rate system -> may buy foreign reserves to buy back its own currency -> speculation -> forced to allow currency to depreciate -> affect FDI

::**Improving BOT**::
* -> decrease in outflow & increased inflow of currency -> currency appreciates
* worsens price competitiveness of firms’ products vs. foreign products
* imported units become cheaper in domestic currency terms 
* however, uncertainty in stability of currency, affecting I

### Govt
* can affect other macroeconomic goals

#### Goals of EG and full employment

::**Worsening BOT**::
* fall in X-M -> fall in AD -> multiplied fall in national income, output -> increase in unemployment
* however in floating forex system -> worsening BOT -> depreciation of forex rate -> lead to improving BOT -> reduces impact
* if forex rate falls below intervention band, bank may have to buy up local currency -> domestic money falls causing AD to fall via C and I 
* persistently large BOT deficit -> economic crisis -> partly financed from trading partners -> foreign lenders lose confidence in ability to pay back loans -> foreign lenders to cut off all loans 
* cause foreigners to lose confidence in stability of country’s forex rate
* if on managed float exchange rate system -> running down its reserves of foreign currencies -> central banks under speculation -> forced to allow it to depreciate

::**Improving BOT**::
* rise in value of net exports -> rise in AD -> rise in equilibrium national output, output and employment 
* if country on floating exchange rate system -> appreciation of forex rate -> worsening of BOT -> dampen above mentioned rise in national output 
* also puts pressure on forex rate to appreciate beyond desired range, need to sell domestic currency to prevent appreciation -> increase supply of S$ in forex market increasing country’s foreign reserves -> domestic money supply will rise -> AD rises further
* persistent BOP surplus -> protectionism measures to restrict imports

#### Goal of GPL stability 

::**Worsening BOT**::
* if economy initially overheated with high demand pull inflation pressure -> worsening BOT helps to ease this pressure -> depreciation of forex rate -> imported factor input prices increase -> UCOP increase -> AS falls resulting in cost pull inflation

::**Improving BOT**::
* improving BOT -> increase in AD -> demand pull inflation
* however if improving BOT leads to appreciation of exchange rate -> imports cheaper -> reduce imported inflation
