### Movement along AD curve
1. ::**Wealth effect**::
	* assuming no change in nominal wealth, rise in GPL -> fall in real value of HH’s wealth -> fall in purchasing power -> C falls -> real GDP falls
2. ::**Interest rate effect**::
	* GPL falls -> household & firms need less $ to buy G&S -> save more, increasing supply of loanable funds -> downward pressure on IR -> cheaper to borrow & purchase G&S & for firms to borrow for investment -> ^ C & I, ^ in real GDP 
3. ::**International substitution effect**::
	* Rise in GPL -> local goods relatively more expensive -> X falls, M rises (Cd falls) -> real GDP falls

# AD = C + I + G + (X - M)
# Causes of shifts of AD (non-GPL factors)
## Consumption Expenditure (C)
* Autonomous consumption
* Induced consumption

### via autonomous C
1. expectation about **future income level**
	* eg. optimism about future state of economy 
	-> high consumer confidence 
	-> expect income levels to rise, stimulate consumption, increases AD
2. expectation of changes in households’ **real wealth**
	* assets -> feel wealthier & demand more G&S
3. expectation of about **future changes of GPL**
	* HH expect inflation rate rise -> bring consumption forward -> ^ willingness of HH to consume G&S
4. availability of credit
	* credit crunch vs. easy credit
5. interest rate
	* interest rate falls, cost of borrowing money is lower
	* decreases returns on saving -> increases HH willingness to consume more 
	* since opportunity cost of consumption is lower
6. personal income tax
	* disposable income (Yd) = National income (Y) - direct taxation + transfer payments
	* higher personal income tax -> HH face fall in disposable income -> reduce willingness & ability to consume -> AD falls
 
## Investment Expenditure (I)
1. **Interest Rate**
	* interest -> cost of investment by firms 
	* MB of investment -> expected rate of return, MC of investment -> interest rate
	* level of investment inversely related to interest rate
2. **Expected rate of return of investment**
	1. Expectations about future business conditions
		* expectation of an economic downturn -> firms to cut on capital spending
		* natural disaster, political unrest, terrorist attacks & changes in govt policies
	2. Technological Advancement
		* new business opportunities -> expectation of higher yield from investment
	3. Corporate tax returns
		* increase expected rate of after-tax profits on investment -> higher returns -> demand more capital goods & increase investment expenditure 
3. **Availability of credit**

## Government Expenditure (G)
1. **Govt policy in response to State of the economy**
2. Access to credit
  
## Net Exports Expenditure (X - M)
1. Foreign income levels
	* ∆ in foreign income -> ∆ in demand by foreigners -> ∆ in economy’s export revenue
2. Prices of foreign produced goods relative to domestic prices
	* domestic HH purchase relatively cheaper domestically produced goods 
	* if demand for imports is price elastic -> import expenditure decreases
	* foreigners to purchase relatively cheaper imports instead of their domestically produced goods
3. Exchange rate
	* appreciation & depreciation of exchange rates
	* if SGD depreciates -> prices of SG exports in terms of foreign currency falls, Qd for SG exports ^
	* SG residents find imported goods more expensive -> switch to SG goods
4. Protectionism
	* restrict free trade -> export quota -> export revenue will fall

## Multiplier Effect
MULTIPLIER -> NO OF TIMES BY WHICH RISE IN EQUILIBRIUM NATIONAL INCOME EXCEEDS RISE IN AUTONOMOUS EXPENDITURE
* an increase in AD due to _______ would lead to AD exceeding the current level of output 
* As firms draw on their inventories to meet extra demand -> unplanned fall in inventories -> firms will increase production -> hire more FOP -> NY increases 
* As households receive more factor income -> spend portion of additional domestic G&S, rise in induced consumption -> ^ AD -> AD shifts from AD1 to AD2
* creates another round of unplanned fall in inventories 
* process repeats where HH spend part of income on consumption of domestic G&S, remaining goes to STM -> ^ W
* process of increase in induced consumption of domestic G&S & increase in output and income will continue until total withdrawals equal total injections again and a new equilibrium national income is achieved
* initial increase in AD led to a multiplied increase in national income due to multiplier effect, assuming spare capacity in economy

## Size of multiplier (k)
# MPW = 1 — MPCd = MPS + MPT + MPM
Marginal propensity to withdraw, consume domestically produced g&s, save, tax, import

1. MPS 
	* countries attitude towards thrift -> eg. Americans have higher level of consumerism
	* social security system -> eg. higher savings rate because govt don’t provide strong social safety net
	* govt policy -> eg. sg, compulsory savings in the form of CPF
	* distribution of income -> more equitable distribution of income increases MPS & lowers multiplier value
2.  MPT 
	* largely dependant on country’s tax system -> higher tax rate -> smaller multiplier
3. MPM
	* largely affected by a country’s factor endowment -> high MPM -> relatively smaller value of multiplier due to higher leakages out of circular flow of income
	* openness to trade

### factors affecting extent of multiplier effect
1. Leakages
	* with higher MPW, more of increase in income leaked out of circular flow in each round -> less spent on induced consumption on domestically produced g&s -> reduces round of spending in multiplier process -> overall increase in NY smaller
2. Lack of spare capacity
	* once economy reaches full-employment, any further increases in expenditure only increases nominal NY -> inflation sets in and price increases
3. Structural rigidities
	* presence of structural bottlenecks -> lack of skilled labour, fixed capital
4. Time lag
	* takes time for multiplier to work eg. take long time for rise in govt spending to have a significant impact on economy 

### AD shock
* when economy nearing full employment level of output 
* AD shock causes AD to rise, actual GDP rises to Yf
* Rise in AD creates shortages and causes an unplanned fall in inventories of stored unsold goods
* firms forced to use resources less and less suitable for their production
* larger amts of FOP required per additional unit of output -> causes unit cost of production to increase 
* firms only produce extra output at higher prices
* equilibrium restored by increase in GPL

## Causes of shifts of AS
### Horizontal AS shift
1. **Prices of factor inputs**
	* increases in prices of either key domestic or imported inputs like crude oil or other raw materials drive up firms’ UCOP, causing AS to fall (horizontal portion shifts upwards)
2. **Exchange rate**
	* depreciation in value of domestic currency -> domestic firms face higher price for imported inputs in terms of domestic currency -> driving up UCOP -> decreases in AS -> shift ^ 
3. **Government policies**
	1. Indirect tax rates -> ^ indirect tax rates (like GST, carbon tax) -> ^ UCOP of firms -> decrease in AS (shift upward)
	2. Government regulation -> increase UCOP -> AS decrease and shift ^  

### Vertical AS shift
1. **Government policies that affect quantity of resources**
	* cause vertical AS to shift as total labour force declines with aging population in SG
2. **Change in quality of labour input**
	* increase in educational levels and training -> increase skills / quality of labour -> increase ability to produce more g&s -> increase productive capacity and increase AS, shifting to the right
3. **Change in technology**
	* investment in new technology improves capital productivity -> increase efficiency -> increases AS shift to the right 
4. Incidence of natural disasters
	* may cause destruction and permanent decrease in capital stock of a country -> decrease in AS
