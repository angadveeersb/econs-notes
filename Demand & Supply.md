# Demand & Supply 
#economics
[[Econs Revision]]

- [ ] explain the types of elasticities (definition, value, positive negative factors, examples)
- [ ] TR/TE
- [ ] sharp increase in price
- [ ] change in market (price and qty)

## demand 
1. EGYPT-AI 
	1. **Expectation** of future price changes
	2. **Government** policies
	3. Change in **income** level
	4. Change in **price** and **population structure**
	5. Change in **taste/preferences**
	6. **Availability** of **credit**/**Interest rate**
2. The price of good rising / falling due to rising / falling demand and rising / falling supply 
3. The fall in supply and the rise in demand uses a shortage at the original equilibrium price as Qd>Qs, 
4. Frustrated consumers bid up the prices of the good, putting an upward pressure on price. 
5. As price rises, the quantity demanded falls as consumer are less willing to purchase the good and quantity supplied rises as producing the good  becomes more profitable until a new equilibriums reached
6. Equilibrium price of the good has risen

## supply
1. Supply factor - PERMS TIP
	1. **Production** of related goods
	2. **Expectation** of future price changes
	3. **Random shocks**
	4. **MCOP**
		1. **Technological change** 
		2. **Input prices** (fop)
		3. **Policy** of government
	5. **Sellers**
2. Marginal cost of production
3. Rise/fall in MCOP
4. Earn Profits / Lose Profits?
5. Become more / less **willing** and **able** to produce good at every price level which leads to an increase / decrease in supply

## diagrammatic analysis
### surplus
1. A fall in demand _(illustrated by a leftward shift of the demand curve from d1 to d2)_ and a rise in supply _(seen by a rightward shift of supply from s1 to s2)_ results in a **surplus** at the original equilibrium price P1 as _quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded_ Qs>Qd
2. Justify change demand / supply 
3. This surplus puts a **downward pressure** on the price as producers clear their excess stock by lowering the price
4. As price falls, the _quantity demanded Qd rises_ as consumers become **more willing and able** to purchase sugar as it has become more rational consumers increase purchases to obtain greater net benefit
5. _quantity supplied falls_ as production becomes **less profitable** until a new equilibrium E’ is reached
6. Equilibrium output has risen from Q1 to Q2

FEAR: **Factor** (demand/supply), **Explanation**, **Adjustment** process, **Relate** back to qn

## sequential analysis
1. Holding demand constant at D, the rise in supply from S to S’ will lead to a rise in total revenue because the fall in revenue from the fall in price (state area) is lesser than the rise in revenue from the more than proportionate increase in Qd (state area). 
2. (Price elasticity)
3. TR increases from ___ to ___ as we move from E to E’
4. Holding supply constant at S, the fall in demand would result in a fall in total revenue since equilibrium price and quantity both decreases
5. Explain using price elasticity, increase in TR from rise in supply VS fall in demand, etc. effect on overall rise in TR

## evaluation
1. ::LR::
2. ::Context:: (different income levels, different PED, different perception of YED)
	1. Different PED based on taste and preferences
	2. Different YED because of emerging countries like India, where inferior goods are normal goods
3. ::Ceteris paribus assumption:: (how it changes MCOP, or demand)
