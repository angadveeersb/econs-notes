# Fiscal Policy
#economics

## Definitions 
* Fiscal Policy — involves govt **changing level of taxation** (T) and/or **govt spending** in order to influence the AD and level of economic activity  
* Government Budget = Tax Revenues - Govt Spending
* Govt spending = government expenditure + transfer payment
* Direct taxes — taxes imposed on all forms of income eg. Personal income tax and corporate tax
* Indirect taxes — compulsory levy imposed on sale of g/s — GST

## Discretional FP
* deliberate manipulation of taxes and govt spending to achieve macro objectives
* govt can adopt expansionary or contractionary FP to inc/dec AD respectively

### Expansionary FP
* reducing direct taxes and/or increasing govt spending
* govt can increase G by building infrastructure, give more transfer payments &/or cutting direct taxes 

	* expansionary Fp increase AD lead to rightward shift of AD
* unplanned fall in inventories -> firms increase production by hiring more FOP eg. labour
* HH income increases -> increase in PP -> induce higher consumption of other g/s -> another cycle of spending -> multiplier process lead to increase in real GDP -> actual EG & fall in DD unemployment

### Contractionary FP
* raising direct taxes &/or decreasing govt spending

* govt can decrease G by building less infrastructure resulting in fall in demand for g/s, 
* decrease C by giving less transfer payments to households -> HH lesser PP, 
* and decrease C and I by raising taxes

* contractionary Fp decrease AD lead to leftward shift of AD 
* unplanned rise in inventories -> firms decrease production and hire less FOP eg. Labour
* resulting rise in unemployment means firms better able to get resources that they need, resulting in more efficient factor combinations and falling UCOP
* less inflationary pressure in economy and GPL decreases 

## Evaluation of Policies: Effective or Appropriate?
1. Crowding Out effect
	* Government has to borrow to finance government expenditure 
	* Happens when govts become indebted from prolonged budget deficits 
	* Borrowing -> increase in demand for loanable funds -> increase in interest rates -> increase cost of borrowing
	* Households will have more incentive to save and borrowers will borrow less to spend on g/s (lower C) as interest rate earnings they get from banks are higher
	* Firms cut back on I due to lower ROI 
	* Hence increase in government spending offset by lower I and C

2. Size of multiplier
	* Effectiveness of fiscal policy is limited if countries have a **small multiplier**
	* Size of multiplier determined by MPW (MPS + MPT + MPM). High MPW will have a small multiplier size
	* Difficult for fiscal policy to raise output and employment levels for countries with small multipler due to higher propensity to withdraw, therefore multiplied increase in real GDP is limited
	* Compare US vs. SG (consumerist vs. saving culture) Sg reliant on energy food and raw materials hence MPM high, Asian frugality and compulsory saving schemes such as CPF means MPS is also high 

3. Size of domestic and govt sector
	* EFP aimed to increase C and I nmay not have much impact for a country with small domestic sector like SG where domestic Cd accounts for only 37% of GDP vs. Australia 58%
	* impact of FP limited if govt sector small relative to export sector and domestic sector eg. SG hit by global recession G increased but unlikely to be enough to make up for fall in X given X is 176% of GDP  
4. Consumer and investor confidence
5. Time lags
6. Conflicts with other macroeconomic goals
7. Unintended consequences of fiscal measures
