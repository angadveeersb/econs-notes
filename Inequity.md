# Inequity
#economics
[[Econs Revision]]

* inequality leads to inequity
	* individuals’ ability to pay different depending on income levels — income inequality
	* leads to inequity in distribution of output in a free market
	* free market does not consider fairness in distribution of goods
	
## Income Inequality 
* Gini coefficient A / (A+B) using the _Lorenz Curve_ 45º equality line
* ::Causes::
	* unequal factor endowments (_difference in income due to unequal ownership of assets_)
	* difference in prices of the same FOP (_skilled VS unskilled labour_)

## Wage Differentials
* ::Market Demand::
	* **Movement** along labour demand curve
		1. ⬆ wage rate -> ⬇ qty of labour demanded Qd
	* **Shift** of the labour demand curve
		1. Change in price of output due to change in demand for good (_concept of derived demand_)
		2. Change in labour productivity _effect of automation_
		3. Change in capital productivity (capital-labour substitution -> lower labour demand) 
* ::Market Supply::
	* **Movement** along labour supply curve
		1. ⬆ wage rate -> ⬆ qty of labour supplied Qs
			* leisure incurs an increased opportunity cost -> sacrificed for higher wage rate
	* **Shift** of the labour supply curve
		1. Change in how many people can get qualified (_innate abilities / govt. policies_)
		2. Change in labour productivity _effect of automation_
		3. Change in capital productivity (_capital-labour substitution -> lower labour demand_) 
		4. Change in population demographics (_ageing population_)
		5. Change in foreign labour policy (_immigration_)
		6. Change in attractiveness of job role
* wage rates differ due to factor immobility

## maximum price — price ceiling
* maximum permissible price that producers may legally charge for a G/S
* to make goods more affordable
* shortage at Pmax of QsQd units
* alternative solution
	* first come-first served basis
	* rationing through coupons
	* sellers’ preferences
	* random allocation
* effects 
* Qs < socially optimum level at Q
* Fall in output -> welfare loss of the triangle for  Qe-Qs units
* increase in total social benefit (area under MSB curve) > Increase in total social cost (area under the MSC curve)
* CS: consumers able to obtain good at lower price benefit but some consumers no longer to obtain since qty purchased drops
* PS: loss of area

## minimum price — price floor
* By legislation
	* Qd Falls to Qd -> consumer surplus lowered
	* reduce qty supplied
	* wastage of product
	* minimum price -> change in producer surplus (increased) 
	* net welfare loss of triangle
* government buying up surplus
	* Qs increases to Qs and Qd falls to Qd
	* CS decreases	 & PS increases (sum increases by the triangle above equilibrium)
	* but government has to buy up Pmin(Qs-Qd)
	* net welfare loss of M shaped area due to allocative inefficiency
	* producers beneficiaries while consumers forced to buy less and pay more

## Minimum wage
* improves productivity
* increased unemployment
* allocative inefficiency -> Qd < Qs
* ineffectiveness of policy 
	* (incentivise workers to illegally work sat lower wage rate defraud govt of income tax)
	
## Income Redistribution
* Transfer payments 
	* Boost income / purchasing power 
* Government vouchers
	* increase consumers ability to purchase goods -> shift demand curve to the right
	* improve equity & std of living
	* if initial equilibrium is allocative efficient
		* demand curve shifts right
		* new output > socially optimal output of Q1 -> allocative ineffiecient
		* ⬆in total benefit < ⬆ in total cost -> additional units result in welfare loss
	* effective, cost effective
	* high costs, ineffective due to criteria to assess eligibility

## Income Redistribution
* Progressive Direct Taxation
	* productive inefficiency -> workers hold back on maximum productivity
	* additional effort -> potential wage increases & taxed more heavily
* Wealth Taxation -> tax on assets like property and vehicles

## Indirect Taxation (levied on G&S)
* Discourage consumption 
	* consumers’ ignorance 
* Raise tax revenue to finance govt spending
Two types
* ::Specific Tax:: 
	* **fixed amt per unit sold**
	* parallel upward shift
* ::Ad valorem tax:: 
	* **levied as a percentage of selling price** 
	* pivotal upward shift (larger shift at higher price levels)
* adds on to MCOP, supply falls -> curve shifts upwards
* ⬆in total benefit > ⬆ in total cost -> additional units result in net benefit
* due to tax, not produced -> loss in net benefit -> welfare loss
* enhanced affordability for poor -> tax revenue
* flexible -> taxes allow market mechanism to operate
	* increase production of essential goods and decrease production of luxury goods
* but, trade-off between efficiency and equity -> divert resources away from markets -> welfare loss

## Production Subsidy 
* Payment made by govt to **producers of necessities** to encourage production of certain G/S
* to lower prices -> increasing affordability -> ⬆ affordability
