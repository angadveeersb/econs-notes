# National Income & SOL
#economics

SOL -> _real_ GDP _per capita_
* ::Material:: 
	* Based on the level of consumption _happiness that can be bought_
		* **Quality** and **quantity** of consumer G&S
	* COVID-19 aviation industry — national income decreased, ability to purchase G&S fall, material SOL worsens
* ::Non-material SOL::
	* based on any intangible factor that affects SOL _happiness that cannot be bought_
	* COVID-19 aviation industry — less frequency of air travels, cleaner air

### GDP vs GNI 
* **GDP** — value of all final goods and services produced by FOP **located _within_ a country’s geographical boundaries** within a period of time
* **GNI** — value of all final goods and services produced by FOP **owned by residents of a country** within a period of time
* GNI = GDP + Net factor income from abroad

### Nominal vs Real GDP
* **Nominal** — GDP valued at **current prices** in **that year**
* **Real** — GDP valued at **constant prices** in a  **base year**

### Factor income
* salary/wages
* rent
* dividend
* interest

### Limitation of using real national income per capita to compare SOL over time
1. Data collection problems
	* omission, double counting, inflation of figures, tax evasion
2. Size of underground economy
	* illegal production
	* legal activities undeclared in income tax returns (moonlighting, casual jobs) 
3.  Changes in the size of Non-market Economy
	* Home-based / voluntary activities — understates true level of production in economy
	* substinence agriculture — undervaluation of country’s GDP
4. Changes in distribution of national income
	* GDP per capita — income of average citizen
	* inequality — increase in real GDP 
	* use Gini Coefficient as supplementary indicator
5. Changes in consumption of national income 
	* country’s output = consumption goods & investment goods but current material well-being only depends on consumption goods
	* ^ capital goods -> ^ national income ≠ ^ current SOL
	* ^ income generated from exports not spent on consumer goods -> overstate rise in SOL
6. Ignores non-material aspect of SOL
	1. Negative externalities — higher levels of pollution -> overstate increase in SOL
	2. Leisure time — work harder or longer hours -> increase in national income -> overstate improvement in QOL
		* national income rises & length of work day shortens (^ in labour productivity) -> understate improvement in SOL

### Limitation of using national income per capita to compare SOL btw countries
1. Inaccuracy of national income figures
	* underground and non-marketed economy <- developing countries 
2. Differences in currencies used and problems with using market exchange rates
	* fluctuating exchange rates (GDP changes not due to changes in actual levels of economy)
	* do not reflect relative differences in prices -> convert to purchasing power parity (PPP) rate 
3. Differences in distribution of income
	* income inequality
4. Differences in proportion of national income spent on different types of goods
	* defence vs. other consumption goods
	* consumption goods vs. Investment goods
5. Differences in non-material SOL
	* differences in external costs
	* differences in hours of work vs. leisure time

### HDI — Human Development Index
1. **Life expectancy index**
	* Material — healthy food options for nutrition, quality healthcare services -> longevity
	* Non-material — Work-life balance and quality of air
2. **Education index** (access to educational materials)
	* mean years of schooling
	* expected years of schooling
3. **Income Index** (GNI per capita at PPP)
	* purchasing power
