## Market-oriented policies 
1. Taxes
	1. ::Production tax::
		1. **Tax on output**
		2. _Reduce consumption / production levels_
		3. **Per unit output tax** equal to MEC at socially optimum output Q* -> forcing firms to **internalise** external costs
		4. Raises MPC -> fall in supply 
		5. Tax = MEC, SS⬆ -> SS’ by MEC 
			* shift vertically upwards
		5. Fall in market equilibrium output -> welfare loss eliminated -> allocative efficiency
	2. ::Pollution tax::
		* Carbon tax 2019
		* **Fixed fee per unit of pollution**
		* _Creates incentives to reduce pollutants / emissions_
		* If MPB (saving pollution cost by reducing pollution) > MPC (of installing equipment lowering production)
			1. ⬆MPC -> MPC’
			2. Extent of impact on third parties reduced from ⬇MEC -> MEC’
			3. Reduce welfare loss -> more allocative efficient outcome
2. Subsidies
	1. Subsidies = MEB at socially optimum output Q*
	2. Increase supply & Lower price -> incentivising consumers to **internalise MEB to society**
	3. Lower producers’ MPC
	4. SS shifts vertically downwards to SS’ by amount MEB at Q’
	5. New market equilibrium -> Welfare loss eliminated -> Allocative efficiency restored
3. Tradable permits
	1. Incentivised to find cleaner methods of production to reduce pollution
4. Grants/Vouchers
	1. Increase consumers’ ability to spend on G/S

## Command Policies
	1. Direct provision (public goods/ G&S)
		1. Possibility of creating greater welfare loss due to **overconsumption** -> Charge a lower price
		2. Joint provision: public x private sector: can produce a service together
			1. Creates competition for government enterprise & addresses the problem of underproduction by private sector
	2. Rules & Regulations
		1. Total Ban
			1. Deadweight loss of Area A eliminated but _also lose net total social benefit from consuming/producing Q* Area B_
			2. **If B > A**, will improve society’s welfare
			3. Desirable or not: depends on extent of negative externality
		2. Quotas — ⬇ qty sold to Q2 

## Other Policies
1. Public education
	1. Provide info to address imperfect info to educate on true MPB
	2. Encourages more/less consumption of good

## Evaluation of Govt. Intervention
* ::Effectiveness of measure::
	1. Does measure correct market failure?
		1. fall/rise to socially optimal output level?
		2. Constraints/limitations?
		3. Assumptions hold effective in context?
	2. Root cause/Symptom of problem?
	3. Time required for policy to take effect
	4. Cognitive biases affect decisions of economic agents
		* Sunk cost fallacy (desensitised to additional costs to previous investment in resources)
		* Loss Aversion (Prefer avoiding a loss over making an equivalent or greater gain)
		* Salience bias (Focus on more prominent/visible info)
* ::Appropriateness of measure::
	5. Unintended consequences? Trade-off with / aid other economic goals
	6. Long term sustainability 
		* Difficult to sustain?
	Cost-efficiency 
		* Least cost method?
	8. Non-economic
		* Public acceptability (equitable?) / Political (popular?)
