## Overview
### Economic Costs of Production
* **Explicit Costs** — actual monetary payments paid to owners of FOPs for use of FOPs not owned by firm — eg. Cost of raw materials paid to suppliers, wages, rent
* **Implicit Costs** — costs of using FOPs that does not involve direct payment to another party — opportunity cost of using FOP that firm already owns — eg. Owner could have done something else instead of the business, eg. Lease out shop, work for someone

## Theory of Costs & Production
::SR refers to the time period in which there is at least one fixed factor input::
* Fixed Costs (FC) — costs that do not vary with the level of production — contracts
* Variable Costs (VC) — costs that vary positively with level of output
* Total Costs (TC) = TFC + TVC
* Marginal Cost (MC) = ∆TC / ∆Q = ∆TVC / ∆Q 
* Average Total Costs (ATC) = Total costs per unit of output = AVC + AFC
* Average Variable / Fixed Cost (AFC) — variable / fixed costs per unit of output = T(V/F)C / Q

### Law of diminishing marginal returns — LMDR
* At the start, marginal product increases due to increasing specialisation and division of labour
* However, after **a point**, each additional factor input will contribute a smaller amount to output
* MC cuts ATC at its minimum point -> when MC < ATC, ATC must be falling since additional unit of output is less than average. MC > ATC, ATC rising

### Long run
* LR -> time period when all factors used in production process are variable (no fixed costs)
* Internal economics of scale (EOS) refer to decreases in firm’s unit of production when the scale of production increases
* dis-EOS (internal diseconomies of scale) UC rises even as output expands
* external EOS — when industry grows in size, external EOS for all its member firms. -> Lower UC when industry it operates in expands, converse for external dis-EOS

## Economies of Scale
::INTERNAL::
* Cost savings due to firm’s own expansion

**Reasons**
Economies
1. Increased productivity 
2. Spreading of fixed costs
3. Principle of increased dimension
4. Greater buying power — loans at lower IR, bulk discounts

Diseconomies
1. Difficulties in communication and coordination of operations
 
::EXTERNAL::
* Cost savings due to growth in industry firm is in 

**Reasons**
Economies
1. Firms can outsource parts of production process
2. Allows firms to tap on common resources

Diseconomies
1. Rise in UCOP due to over-expansion of industry
