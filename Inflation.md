# Inflation
#economics

## Terms
* ::Inflation:: — situation where there is a sustained increase in the GPL of an economy
* ::GPL:: - average price of all G/S in economy during a period of time
* ::Consumer Price Index (CPI):: — changes in price of fixed basket of G/S commonly purchased 
* ::Stagflation:: — high unemployment & Rapid inflation with negligible growth in national output / contraction of national output
* ::Deflation:: — A sustained decrease in GPL of economy
* ::Disinflation:: — Inflation rate in still positive but still declining over time
* ::Real value of money:: — real value of a unit of money is its purchasing power of qty of G/S that it can buy 
	* Real value of money & GPL inversely related 
* ::Internal Value of $$:: — domestic PP 
* ::External Value of $$:: — foreign exchange rate — how many units of foreign currency one unit of local currency can buy 

## Causes of Inflation
### Demand Pull Inflation
* Due to **continuing increases in AD when economy is near or at full employment**
* Profit motivated firms increase production — increase output and operate closer to full capacity or Yf -> production becomes less efficient. 
* Firms use resources that are less & less suitable for production. Larger amounts of labour & other inputs required per additional unit of output — UCOP increases increase in production only if can be sold at higher prices -> increase in GPL

#### Causes of Rise in AD
::Non Monetary::
1. Increased consumer spending
2. Increased investment spending (inc. in exp. ROI)
3. Increased export revenue (due to depreciation of country’s currency -> make its exports cheaper in foreign currency)
4. Increased export revenue (from foreigners due to rise in trade partners’ income)
::Monetary::
Increase in country’s money supply -> demand pull inflation
Too much money chasing after too few few g/s

### Cost Push Inflation
* Due to **continual increases in UCOP which are not caused by increases in AD**
* Rise in UCOP -> firms willing to produce same output level only if they receive higher prices
* AS falls -> **horizontal segment of AS shifts UP** -> GPL rises as firms pass higher UC on to consumers
* Stagflation occurs — Prices rise while real national output falls

#### Causes of Cost-push inflation
1. Wage-Push — shrinking labour force / wage rate rises faster than rise in labour productivity -> inflation due to rising unit labour cost
2. Increase in price of imported inputs — rise in price of imported input which are key inputs to produce a variety of products
3. Tax-push inflation — indirect taxes like GST -> increase UCOP

## Effects of Inflation!
### Consumers
* Inc. in cost of living (Basket of g/s)
* Rate of change in **real income** = rate of change of nominal income - inflation rate 
### Producers
* Demand-pull -> profit margins increase because price of g/s tend to rise faster than UCOP. SR - factor input prices unchanged due to long term contracts
* Cost-push -> profit margins decrease because rise in ICOP not due to rise in AD -> firms pass partial rise in costs to consumers -> decline in profit margin
### Govt (MACRO)
#### Economic Growth & Unemployment
1. Consumption & Saving -> savings discourages when real value of savings falling -> converted to other assets
2. Investment -> low & stable inflation — investment encouraged (more certainty) -> increase in I leads to accumulation of capital goods, assuming rater of CA exceeds CD rate. Increase in capital stock increase AS -> AS shifts right -> potential growth -> provides basis for sustained economic growth  
	* demand-pull -> increase in ROI -> increase in I
	* cost-push -> profits lowered -> decrease in I
Inc/Dec in I results in positive / negative growth
#### BOT & Foreign Ex Rate
1. BOT
	* impact of inflation on country’s BOT depends on how its inflation compares with that in other countries
	* domestic inflation -> locally produced goods become relatively more expensive compared to imports
	* domestic exports become less price competitive in world markets leading to fall in qty demanded for exports from local, if demand for exports is price elastic increase in GPL will lead to a more than proportionate fall in qty demanded for exports, leading to fall in export revenue
2. External value of country’s currency (forex rate)
	* local consumers demand more foreign currencies to buy imports which results in an increase in supply of home currency in forex market to exchange for foreigners currencies
	* exports become less price competitive leading to fall in qty demanded for exports and fall in export revenue -> fall in foreigners demand for home currency 
	* downward pressure on forex rate & domestic currency will depreciate
### Govt (MICRO)
#### Equity — Arbitrary Redistribution of Wealth & income 
1. Fixed vs variable income earners (real income falls for fixed while variable income earners may gain during inflation)
2. Savers vs. borrowers — Real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate 
3. Govt vs. taxpayers — progressive tax structure, inflation causes nominal wages to rise — rising wages of taxpayers pushes them into higher marginal tax brackets -> have to pay a larger fraction of their nominal income in taxes even though the real income may not have increased -> govt gains more tax revenue & taxpayers face falling real disposable income in times of inflation
What can be done?
Workers — indexation of wage contracts — link money wages to CPI — real income relatively unchanged in inflation
Creditors — indication of loan / debt contracts to ensure real interest rate is maintained
Tax bracket indication — nominal tax brackets adjusted automatically in proportion to changes in GPL  to compensate for bracket creep 
#### Efficiency - Wastage and Misallocation of Resources
1. Distortion of price mechanism — difficult for producer to distinguish whether change in relative prices is due to increase in demand for product or change in prices due to inflation -> misallocation of resources reducing the efficiency of the market mechanism
2. Wastage of resources — Menu costs -> cost of deciding on new prices, changing price labels and printing menus or catalogs

## Deflation
Cause: Factors that lead to a fall in AD and/or a rise in AS
### Due to falling AD
* decreases in foreigners’  income -> cause them spend lower on exports 
* credit crunch following a financial crisis -> decrease in C and I
* fiscal austerity -> govt cuts spending
**Explanation**
* AD falls -> firms respond by lowering output -> rise in unemployment -> firms better able to get the resources that they need, resulting in more efficient factor combinations and falling UCOP
* once there is a fall in GPL, likely to be further decreases in AD -> persistent falls in the GPL
* Fall in GPL -> consumers expect prices to drop further and post-pone current spending

### Due to rising AS
* Decreases in prices of key imported inputs -> decreases in UCOP
* appreciation of forex rate -> decreases in prices of imported inputs in local currency & hence decreases in UCOP
* Improvement in technology and hence increases in factor productivity -> increases country’s productive capacity + lowers UCOP
**Explanation**
* UCOP falls -> AS rises 
* Firms respond by increasing quantity supplied
* With access AS, firms have to cut prices to stimulate spending and so reduce the excess supply
* GOOD -> national output rises whilst prices are falling

## EFFECTS OF DEFLATION
### Consumers’ perspective
* assuming no change in HH nominal income, deflation results in rise in HH real income -> improvement in MSOL 
* demand-side deflation nominal income remains unchanged in SR (wage contracts) but in LR nominal income falls 
* hold back consumption -> decreases in AD -> decreases in HH real income
* in supply-side deflation -> in SR nominal incomes unchanged -> rise in HH real income in LR nominal income rises as firms bid up wage rates in attempts to hire more workers to increase output

### Producers’ perspective
* Deflation due to falling AD -> profit margins fall (prices of g/s likely to be falling faster than COP)
* Deflation due to rising AS -> profit margins rise in SR as decline in price of g/s likely to be lesser than fall in UCOP 

### Govts’ perspective
::EFFECT ON MACRO GOALS::
#### Economic Growth and Unemployment 
**DD-side deflation**
* Fall in consumption / rise in saving — 
	* in anticipation of further decreases in prices
	* negative wealth effect — dampen personal sector financial wealth
	* leads to increase in real IR -> (real IR = nominal IR - inflation rate) higher real IR encourage saving & discourage borrowing -> discouraging consumption
* Fall in investment
	* rise in IR -> firms discouraged from borrowing 
	* lower AD -> exp. ROI falls -> discouraged 
Fall in C and I leads to decreases in GPL and national output -> negative actual EG -> investment also lowers PG as it causes a slowdown in expansion of country’s capital stock

**SS-side deflation**
Effect on macroeconomy should not be adverse as AD rises via real balances, international substitution and interest rate effects -> rise in GDP
Since NY rising during ss-side deflation consumer business sentiments still buoyant hence AD may not fall

#### BOT and Forex Rate
**BOT**
* Deflation -> locally produced goods become relatively cheaper -> qty demanded for imports (M) falls 
* Exports become more price competitive in world markets -> rise in qty demanded for X -> rise in X
* Country’s BOT improves 
**Forex Rate**
* deflation -> reduction in spending of imports -> decrease in supply of home currency in forex market
* exports become more price competitive in world markets -> rise in foreigners’ DD for home currency 
* upward pressure on forex rate -> domestic rate appreciates

::EFFECT ON MICRO GOALS::
#### Equity — arbitrary redistribution of Y
1. Fixed vs. variable income earners -> fixed gain (real income rises) 
2. Creditors vs. debtors -> debtors lose & creditors gain (real IR and real value of amt borrowed to rise)
#### efficiency — misallocation of resources 
1. Distortion of price mechanism (decrease in price = due to decrease in demand / due to general deflation??) -> inaccurately devote less resources to it
2. Wastage of resources — menu costs
