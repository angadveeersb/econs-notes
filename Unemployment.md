## Factors affecting rate of unemployment
1. **Size of labour force**
* Labour force participation rate 
	* Market wage rate
	* social attitudes towards working women
	* provision for care of children and elderly	
2. **Composition of Labour force** — educational and skill qualifications of workforce 
3. **Labour productivity** (output produced per man-hour) — higher LP -> more DD for labour

## Types of Unemployment
### Demand-deficient / Cyclical unemployment
* caused by fall in AD
* cyclical -> fluctuates with business cycle

* **Explanation**: Fall in AD -> unable to sell current level of output -> cut back on production + reduce demand for labour (since labour is derived demand) -> fall in NY trigger cuts in consumer spending due to multiplier effect
* Yf-Y1 illustrated presence of demand deficient unemployment

* Demand shifts from Dl1 to Dl2 during recession 
* Wages are sticky downwards or inflexible -> wages do not fall 
* L1-L2 represents demand deficient unemployment at W1 given it is market equilibrium wage

::Why are wages sticky downwards?::
1. Wage contracts
2. Employees morale
3. Fear of the best people leaving 

### Structural unemployment
* Caused by structural changes in the economy and occupational immobility — mismatch of skills 
1. A change in the method of production 
New technology and techniques of production allow same level of output produced with fewer workers — technology results in jobs and skills becoming obsolete, creates new jobs, _unemployed unable to fill new posts as old skills may no longer be applicable_
**Occupational immobility** — structural unemployment and those retrenched do not possess the skills in demand to take up jobs in other sectors of the economy
2. Globalisation — some workers may not have relevant skills to move on to globalised industries
3. A change in the pattern of demand — declining demands and change in consumer tastes
4. Other reasons — regional unemployment — geographical immobility, not willing to move to other regions with jobs due to difference in housing pricing etc.

### Frictional Unemployment
* takes time for people who have left their previous jobs or have just entered the labour force to find jobs
* might not want to take the job they are offered hoping for a better job
#### Causes 
1. Imperfect information — unaware of the available jobs and what they entail & employers not aware of what labour is available
2. Incentives problems — may not want to be employed if they believe the tax and benefit system will reduce net increase in income from taking work eg. High income tax rates / high unemployment benefits
## Consequences of Unemployment
1. Consumers -> loss of income lower MSOL
2. Firms -> lower consumption due to loss of income or worsening of consumer confidence -> lower production and sales of g/s -> lower revenue for firms 
Poor business confidence -> lower I
3. Govt 
	* loss of tax revenue T
	* goat expenditure increases as more unemployment benefits given out
	* worsening of govt budget balance
4. economy
	* productive inefficiency -> economy will be at point within PPC
	* fall in investment by firms -> downward multiplier effect -> slow down PG
	* higher crime rates
