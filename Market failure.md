[[Econs Revision]]

- [ ] causes of market failures
- [ ] cures for market failure
they can ask:
- [ ] explain the workings of price mechanism (signal incentive rationing)
- [ ] how is allocative efficiency achieved in market
- [ ] explain causes of market failure
- [ ] explain how the policy can address the market failure cause
- [ ] which is best policy (must have 3 policies)
then for each policy, we need to explain how it works, how it helps improve allocative efficiency, and pros and cons

## Price Mechanism (Allocative Efficiency)
* 3 qns
	1. ::What and how much to produce?:: — Signalling
	2. ::How to produce?:: — Signalling
	3. ::For whom to produce?:: — Rationing
* Signalling — what, how much and how to produce?
	* consumer sovereignty -> voting 
	* vote for firms to produce through their purchases & vote against 
	* ‘dollar votes’
	* Firms devote resources to produce G/S only if profitable (Qs=Qd)
	* Prices rise and fall to reflect shortages and surpluses -> change production levels accordingly
	* eg. Rise in income -> indicate preference by **willingness to pay** higher price -> shortage @ initial price level -> rise in price **acts as a signal** -> incentivises profit-motivated firms to expand production -> enter markets for FOP & demand for more eg. labour -> higher prices signal to buy lesser units
	* Mix FOP by reacting to different factor prices to determine — how
* Rationing — for whom to produce
	* Households who value a good more **willing and able to pay higher price** 
	* Profit-maximising firms hence produce and distribute good to them 

### Marginalist Principle
* Rational consumers seek to maximise the net total private benefits from buying and consuming a G/S 
	* MPB > MPC
	* Maximum price willing to pay for one more unit represents the marginal utility he derives from consuming that additional unit
* Rational producer seeks to maximise total profits from producing and selling G/S
	* MPB > MPC 
	
## Terms
* Perceived MPB = DD, True MPB = MSB (DD’)
* SS = MPC
* Market equilibrium output 
* Socially optimal output 
* Deadweight loss
* Allocative efficiency
* Consumer surplus - Difference between the price consumers are willing to pay for the unit of good or service and the market price they actually pay 
* Producer surplus - Difference between what producers are willing and able to supply the unit of good for and the price they actually receive

## Causes of market failure 
1. Externalities (+ve/-ve)
	1. MSB = MPB + MEB (**additional benefit enjoyed**, _by third parties_, _indirectly involved production/consumption of good_ )
		* ::Market equilibrium output:: at Q where _DD=SS_, ::Market equilibrium price:: at P
		* ::Socially optimal output:: and price is at Q* and P* where _MSB = MSC & society welfare maximised_
		* **Underconsumption** by Q*-Q -> welfare loss
		* society welfare not maximised -> _free market failed to achieve allocative efficiency_
	2. MSC = MPC + MEC  (**additional cost imposed**, _on third parties_, _indirectly involved production/consumption of good_ )
		* **Overproduction** by Q-Q* -> welfare loss
2. Imperfect info
	1. Consumer ignorance
		* Perceived MPB = DD < True MPB = MSB (DD’)
		* **Assuming no externalities** MSB = True MPB, MSC =MPC=SS 
		* standard explanation
	2. Asymmetric info -> Leads to Adverse Selection
		1. Uninformed / Knowledgeable sellers / buyers
		2. Either buyers or sellers has better info than the other -> _distortion of incentives_ & _inefficient market outcomes_
		3. ::Supplier induced demand:: 
			* Perceived MPB > True MPB -> overconsumption of service -> welfare loss
3. Factor immobility
	1. **Occupational immobility** & **Geographical immobility**
4. Market dominance
5. Public good
	1. ::Non-excludable:: -> everyone enjoys public good, regardless of whether they paid or not
		* Free riders 
		* No effective demand as consumers are unwilling to pay -> no production of PG
	2. ::Non-rivalrous:: -> when one person consumes public good, it does not reduce level for others
