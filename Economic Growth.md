## Factors affecting Actual Growth
1. Increase in AD
2. Decrease in UCOP
	* Decrease in UCOP, AS rises
	* horizontal portion of AS curve shifts down 
	* Fall in GPL 
	* **Wealth effect, International substitution effect -> movement along AD curve** 
	* equilibrium restored at higher national output

## Factors affecting Potential Growth
* Through increases in quantity of FOP / increases in quality or productivity of its available FOP
* Quantity — More factor inputs available for production of G&S
* Quality — each unit of FOP can produce more output in a given time, More output can be produced with same qty. of FOPs available
### Factors affecting Quantity of FOP
1. Capital 
	* domestic investment
		* country’s level of saving
		* domestic rate of interest (cost of borrowing)
		* entrepreneurs’ level of confidence about future business and economic outlook of economy
		* corporate tax rate
	* foreign investment
		* entrepreneurs’ level of confidence about future business and economic outlook of economy 
		* corporate tax rate
		* exchange rate stability
		* ease of doing business (trade policies, strong legal framework, good infrastructure, good banking system, labour laws)
2. Labour — qty
	* Average working hours per worker
	* Size of labour force (working population / economically active population)
		* Changes in population size / changes in population structure
		* foreign labour flows
3. Land — Natural resources  
	* discovery of new mineral deposits
	* depletion — sea pollution & deforestation
	* land reclamation, optimising land use
4. Entrepreneurs  
	* legal framework, funding, risk taking innovative thinking culture

### Factors affecting Quality of FOP
1. Labour productivity
	* GDP per employed person = GDP / Total employed people
	* GDP per hour worked = GDP / Total no. of hours worked
2. Total factor productivity (TFP) — amt of output obtained from given qty of all inputs used in pdtn
	* Level of physical capital — increases productivity of land and labour
	* Level of human capital — knowledge & skills that workers acquire through education training and experience
	* Level of technology — R&D, transfer of knowledge from MNCs

## Sustained Growth
### Benefits of +ve and high economic growth rates
::HH POV::
1. **Higher SOL over time**
	* If real economic growth rate > population growth, real NY per capita ^
	* HH enjoy higher levels of consumption of G&S
	* ^ in material SOL
govt tax revenue ^
	* personal income tax, corporate taxes, sales taxes ^
	* spend more on public goods, merit goods (hc), support for arts, environment 
	* ^ in non material SOL 
2. **Alleviate other macroeconomic problems**
	1. Demand-deficient unemployment
		* economic growth = increase in real output
		* firms hire more labour to increase output 
		* reduction in demand-deficient unemployment (economy < Yf)
	2. Demand-pull inflation
		* potential growth = increase in productive capacity of economy
		* w/o PG -> ^ in AD -> GPL rise -> demand-pull inflation (purchasing power of HH eroded)
3. **Redistributive Benefits**
	* govt tax revenues ^ without raising tax rates
	* Govt can spend on programs to alleviate poverty and improve livelihoods
		1. Developing countries: Subsidies for fam machinery -> improve labour productivity & incomes of poor farmers
		2. Developed countries: E.g. welfare, healthcare benefits to lowest incomes and schemes to reduce inter-generational poverty e.g. pre-school subsidies, meal programs for students from low income families
4. Greater ability of address environmental degradation
	* govt tax revenues ^ -> greater ability to fund measures for addressing pollution & destruction of natural env
	* people become more affluent -> less preoccupied w/ private consumption & more concerned about clean env -> tougher regulation of pollution in developed vs. developing countries

### LOSSES of +ve and high economic growth rates
1. **Lowering of non-material SOL**
	* Longer working hours & higher stress levels
	* increased levels of pollution & faster environmental degradation
2. **Lowering of current material SOL**
	* investment for PG funded by savings by HH -> less consumption by HH in current time period
	* Lower current material SOL 
3. **Trade off with other macroeconomic goals**
	1. Structural unemployment: 
		* Mismatch in skills possessed by jobseekers and those demanded by firms structural unemployment in economy & factor immobility
		* changes in types of goods produced + technology used to produce these goods
		* Faster growth rates correlate to faster pace of structural changes
		* If skills + knowledge of labour force does not improve as quickly as tech advancements -> skills no longer relevant, jobs increasingly being replaced 
	2. Balance of Trade (BOT) = X — M
		* HH induces a spending on imports (by extent of MPM) 
		* lead to deterioration in country’s BOT
4. **Greater inequality in income distribution**
	* greater incentives given to specific sectors of economy, people working in these growth sectors might get wealthier, faster rise in disposable income
	* w.o corresponding transfer of income (redistributive transfers) little or no benefits to people not in these **growth sectors** -> greater inequality in different sectors

## Sustainable Growth
Refers to a rate of growth which is **sustained without creating other significant socio-economic problems** 
* exploitation of non-renewable natural resources -> insufficient natural resources for future generations -> _trade-off_ between rapid economic growth today & material SOL in future
* more pollution, depletion of clean water and breathable air -> decline in non-material SOL
* Govts should aim for slower economic sustainable growth rather than faster growth

### How can economic growth be made more sustainable?
1. **Improve factor productivity**
	* technological advancements -> increased output w/o need to exploit more resources
2. Remove subsidies for fossil fuels & **encourage greater resources allocated to cleaner alternatives / green industries**
	* some govts subsidise pdtn of fossil fuels to spur industrialisation
3. Government intervention to **tackle natural resource exhaustion &/ degradation of environment** 
	* need intervention eg. Taxes or command measures eg. Environmental laws (refer to book 3)

## Inclusive Growth
### Economic Growth — Inequitable 
* insufficient efforts by govt. to redistribute income and wealth 
* specialisation in capital, knowledge, skill or technology as rather than labour as part of industrialisation strategies
### Why Inclusive Growth?
1. **Sustained growth ≠ improved SOL for all**
	* country can grow where rich minority gets richer 
2. **Reduces both AG & PG over time**
	* Profits rising at a much faster rate than wages
	* Rapid rise in profits incentive for entrepreneurs to innovate — source of EG
	* Higher income — higher propensity to save -> higher level of investment for economy
	* **Excessive income inequality is bad for growth**
		* MPC lower for higher income earners -> size of multiplier (k) -> smaller multiplied increase in real GDP -> slowdown in actual growth when AD rises
		* lower income earners -> spending power is capped / growing slowly -> growth in consumption slows -> slower shift of AD to the right
		* leads to political and social instability -> lowered expected rate of returns of investments -> fall in I expenditure -> dampens expansion of AD -> lowers rate of increase in AS -> AG, PG slows
		* lowered support for mainstream political parties in favour of support for populist politics -> makes difficult for govt to pursue necessary policies when needed if involves short term pain & attain macroeconomic goals
### How Inclusive Growth?
1. Policies to redistribute income
	 * ^ in corporate tax rates, higher personal income tax rates for rich + transfer payments for poor
2. Policies to enhance equality of opportunity
	 * inequality — undermines intergenerational social mobility
	 * equal access to high-quality education, skills upgrading & access to finance for entrepreneurship
